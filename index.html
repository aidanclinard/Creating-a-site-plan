    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Aidan Clinard</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Arizona. I am currently working towards a computer science degree. 
    I love to draw and play video games in my free time. I draw video game characters and anime.
    Recently, I have been working on improving my digital work.
    I play video games like Minecraft, TF2, Doom Eternal, and Touhou Hisoutensoku.
    Me and some friends are currently working on a game ourselves. We have been working on it for around a year and a half.
    We've gone through several story rewrites, but we have finally settled on one.
    I look forward to learning more about html coding in this class.</p>
